Second day of Frontend Conf Zürich 13. The schedule looks promising. Here are
my picks of today.

## [Dan Rubini](https://twitter.com/danrubin) - The New Language of Web Design

★★★★✩

_Responsive Web Design_

Term borrowed from architecture. Example: Building in Paris where
the amount of incoming light is changing over the day.

_Scroll_

> A scroll is a roll of papyrus, parchment, or paper which has been written,
> drawn or painted upon for the purpose of transmitting information or using as a
> decoration.

30 years later, apple reinvents scrolling and moves on to panning.

_Naming of bootstrap_

First Blueprint. Too closely connected to styleguide. Blueprint (CSS) already taken.

_Better practice > best practice_

A best practice today may be outdated in a couple of years.

_Fold/Above the fold_

The fold, as used in web design, describes the area which is visible in the
browser's viewport without scrolling. A better practice name for this may be
the scroll.

See: <http://designshack.net/articles/above-the-scroll-does-it-matter-anymore/>

_Bleed_

> Bleed is a printing term that refers to printing that goes beyond the edge of
> the sheet before trimming. In other words, the bleed is the area to be trimmed
> off.
