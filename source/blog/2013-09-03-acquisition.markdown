## tl;dr

Long story short: gorilla software is looking for thrilling and
challenging web projects. If you are searching for a skilled Full Stack
developer for your next web experience drop me a line at
<mailto:hi@gorillasoftware.ch>.

## ˌækwɪˈzɪʃn̩, ★ how I go about that

The vast majority of customer projects I was working on for the
last two years were all assigned to me by former colleagues or friends.
While this is still an solid source for projects, it leaves me with 
a sense of powerlessness.

To broaden the circle of possible customers, I want to put some more
effort into my acquisition methodology. In accordance with point one of
Chad Whitacre's vision of an [open company][1], I will try to outline my
the next steps in this article.

>    Be as open as possible. An open company develops all of its
>    products publicly, and freely shares all of its intellectual
>    property. Any software it writes is open source. It publishes as
>    much financial and other data as it can without compromising
>    customer privacy. All employees of the company are publicly listed
>    along with their level of access to private company information and
>    private customer data.

As a small programming shop this is probably illusionary. But when it
comes to company stuff that does not conflict with any customer's IP or
business secrets I am more than willing to share. Especially when, as a
software developer nowadays, you rely heavily on the openness of other
people when it comes to open source software.

### Talk and leave the comfort zone

As many other people too, I'm shy by nature. Nonetheless, I think it's
an importance to force the coincidence and leave the comfort zone.
I try to go to events, conferences, meetups as much as possible. Meet
people, talk to people.

### Contribute

I try to publish a big part of my work as open source software.

### Write

This is also one of my personal goals. Writing any English text longer
than a tweet or a commit message gives me headaches. I want to work on
that and get more fluent in writing. I guess, for the long term this will
be a huge productivity boost. It could also help, to bundle ideas.

### Be social & be nice

  * Guido: people are spoiled. The first they see is their personal
    benefit
  * Try to figure out what's best for your customer
  * Understand your customer's needs
  * Try to find out, how you could help reach your customer's goals

### Do it all, but do only one thing at a time

This will be a tough nut to crack. I get so easily distracted. There are
a few general practices I try to embrace for my everyday job.

__Paper Checklist__: Most of the time I carry around a moleskine with
all my notes and checklists. Imho, nothing beats the paper checklists.

__Split work into smaller chunks__: I often get lost in little details.
Often I cannot complete a superior task because of some little detail
that doesn't yet feel done. Recently I started to extract such chunks as
own tasks on my todo list. This allows me to finish the superior task
first and then come back to the gory detail later. It helps to keep me
from these days that end without any feeling of achievement.
