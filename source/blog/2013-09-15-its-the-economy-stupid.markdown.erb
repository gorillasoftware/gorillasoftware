## Acquisition (ˌækwɪˈzɪʃn̩,) ★ how I go about that

The vast majority of customer projects I was working on for the
last two years were all assigned to me by former colleagues or friends.
While this is still a solid source for projects, it leaves me with 
a sense of powerlessness. READMORE

To broaden the circle of possible customers, I want to put some more
effort into my acquisition methodology. In accordance with point one of
Chad Whitacre's vision of an [open company][1], I will try to outline my
the next steps in this article.

As a small programming shop, this is probably illusionary. But when it
comes to corporate property that does not conflict with any customer's IP or
business secrets I am more than willing to share. Especially when, as a
software developer nowadays, you rely heavily on the openness of other
people when working with open source software.

### Talk and leave the comfort zone

As many other people too, I'm shy by nature. Nonetheless, I think it's
an importance to force the coincidence and leave the comfort zone.
I try to go to events, conferences, meetups as much as possible. Meet
people, talk to people.

### Contribute

I try to publish a big part of my work as open source software.

As software developer you're probably used 

### Write

This is one of my personal goals. So far, writing any English text longer
than a tweet or a commit message gives me headaches. I want to work on
that and get more fluent in writing. I guess, for the long term this will
be a huge productivity boost. It could also help, to bundle ideas.

### Don't be spoiled

A while ago, I was invited to dinner by a relative of mine. He used to
work as a lawyer and judge, but has been retired for a long time now. We
were comparing businesses now and then when he came up with the
following quote:

> People are spoiled. The first they see is their personal benefit.

At a first glance this may sound a little exaggerated and perhaps true
for law companies, which are not particularly known for their
unselfishness. But there is a grain of truth in it that affects other
industries too.

In my daily work I find myself often confronted with decisions between
state-of-the-art-high-end- and pragmatic-low-tech solution to solve
a problem. As a software developer I often tend towards the high-end
solution, even if there is a other way to solve that particular problem
with much less effort. It's just questionable if this makes your
customer happier. Perhaps there is a canonical checklist for situations
like that, but here are my two cents:

  1. Understand your customer's needs
  2. Figure out, how you could help reach your customer's goals
  3. Take the most pragmatic road
  4. Back to 1

### Do it all, but do only one thing at a time

This will be a tough nut to crack. I get so easily distracted. There are
a few general practices I try to embrace for my everyday job.

_Paper Checklist_: Most of the time I carry around a moleskine with
all my notes and checklists. Imho, nothing beats the paper checklists.

_Split work into smaller chunks_: I often get lost in little details.
Often I cannot complete a superior task because of some little detail
that doesn't yet feel done. Recently I started to extract such chunks as
own tasks on my todo list. This allows me to finish the superior task
first and then come back to the gory detail later. It helps to keep me
from these days that end without any feeling of achievement.
