Here is my short rating and overview of the Thursday talks of Frontend
Conference in Zürich. The ratings are highly subjective.

## Mark Otto - Future of Frontend Frameworks

★★★★✩

Call it Github/Twitter biased, but I liked the speaker. I'm always
thrilled when 'designers' do probably code better than you.

## Hans Christian Reinl - Be Friends With Your Designers and Style Guides

★★✩✩✩

* chaotic, nothing new - The talk didn't seem to me very consistent in
topic.
* when did you last use quotes? - Why is one of the main (and mostly
nicest) styleguide components always a quote.

## Vitaly Friedman - Responsive Web Design: Clever Tips and Techniques

★★★★★

* Very inspiring talk, cutting edge hacks and workarounds
* Shocking: it's 2013 annd we have to apply such patterns

### Atomic design

### Progressive reduction (theory and example)

I guess, this will give developers headache

### SVG/Icon-Stacks

The SVG Stack with the anchor/target CSS style is a neat idea. Sadly,
it's not well supported by the current browsers.

### srcset

This will make `data-src` obsolete, hopefully.

---------------------------------------

## Denys Mishunov - Let me tell you a story

★★★★✩

* Mid-life crisis -- I wasn't totally sure about his intentions, but I
liked his stories.

--------------------------------------

## Urban Etter - Frontend Performance - Where it matters

★✩✩✩✩

* Stuff that is done by any decent framework
* I'm wondering, how serious SRF is taking it's web development

---------------------------------------

* Only access dom/data within it's own scope
* Avoid the need for the DOM
* Personal goal: Write an app without jquery/zepto
* AMD \< commonjs (or ECMAScript 6) in current browsers
* Personal goal: use require.js / bower / TypeScript
